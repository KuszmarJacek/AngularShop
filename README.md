# CrudShop
This is a simple Angular app made for myself so that I can catch up with things new in Angular 16 like signals, as well as other things like reactive forms, routing guards, REST API fetching.

## How to run
First you need to run the server, which provides the Angular app with data. Do so with ```npm run json```
After that start the Angular app with ```ng serve```.

## Notes
This project is not finished, so don't take everything here at face value, because some features are subject to change, be added or removed.
